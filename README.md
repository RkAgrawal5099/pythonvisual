Sales Funnel Visualization
Project Overview
This project generates a Sales Funnel Visualization using Plotly. The funnel chart displays various stages of a sales funnel along with the corresponding quantities for each stage. The data used in this project is simulated to demonstrate how sales typically move through various stages in a funnel, from initial leads to final conversion.

Features
Funnel Chart: Visualizes the quantity at each stage of the sales funnel.
Interactive Chart: Plotly is used to create an interactive funnel chart that displays values and percentages.
Project Setup
Prerequisites
Before running the code, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:

plotly: Used to create the interactive funnel chart.
pandas: For data handling (if necessary for future extensions).
Installation
Install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install plotly pandas
Clone or download the project files to your local machine.

Open the Python script sales_funnel.py or the code block directly in a Jupyter Notebook or your preferred IDE (e.g., VS Code).

Running the Funnel Chart Code
The provided script generates a funnel chart with simulated sales data. To run the code, simply execute the script.

Code Walkthrough
Sales Funnel Data:

The sales funnel has 5 stages: Lead, Contacted, Qualified, Proposal, and Final Conversion.
Each stage has a quantity representing the number of prospects at that stage.
Funnel Chart:

The plotly.graph_objects.Funnel function is used to generate the chart.
The chart includes labels for both the value and the percentage of the initial and previous stages.
Displaying the Chart:

The chart is displayed using funnel_fig.show(), which creates an interactive visualization in a web browser.
Example Usage
python
Copy code
import plotly.graph_objects as go

# Simulated sales funnel data
funnel_stages = ['Lead', 'Contacted', 'Qualified', 'Proposal', 'Final Conversion']
quantities = [500, 400, 300, 200, 100]

# Create a funnel chart using Plotly
funnel_fig = go.Figure(go.Funnel(
    y=funnel_stages,
    x=quantities,
    textinfo="value+percent initial+percent previous"
))

# Update layout for the funnel chart
funnel_fig.update_layout(
    title="Sales Funnel",
    title_x=0.5
)

# Display the funnel chart
funnel_fig.show()
Output
Running the script will generate an interactive funnel chart where each stage displays the following:

The quantity of prospects at that stage.
The percentage of the total initial leads and the percentage change from the previous stage.
Customizing the Chart
You can modify the following parameters to adapt the chart to your needs:

funnel_stages: List of stages in the sales funnel.
quantities: List of quantities corresponding to each funnel stage.
To visualize a different dataset or sales funnel, just modify these lists with your data.

Additional Information
If you want to extend this project:

Integrate actual sales data by replacing the simulated data (funnel_stages and quantities) with real values from your dataset.
Customize the chart's appearance using Plotly's extensive customization options.
